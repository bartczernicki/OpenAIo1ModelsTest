| 1   | Risk of Significant Investments Not Achieving Expected Returns | Microsoft continues to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including specific products like Windows, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and others. Focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. Invests in hardware development and acquisition, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. If customers do not perceive value in the latest offerings, they may reduce purchases, affecting revenue. May not achieve significant revenue from new products for several years, if at all. New products may not be profitable or have lower margins. May not get engagement in features like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat that drive post-sale monetization. Data handling practices are under scrutiny; perceptions of mismanagement could negatively impact product adoption, design, and quality. Developing new technologies is complex and can involve delays; significant delays or problems could adversely affect revenue. | Similar significant investments continue, but without listing specific products. Focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. Invests in hardware development and acquisition, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices (HoloLens omitted). If customers do not perceive value in the latest offerings, they may reduce purchases, affecting revenue. May not achieve significant revenue from new products for several years, if at all. New products may not be profitable or achieve historical margins. May not get engagement in certain features that drive post-sale monetization (no specific products mentioned). Data-handling practices are under scrutiny; perceptions of mismanagement could negatively impact product and feature adoption (no mention of product design and quality). Developing new technologies is complex and can involve delays; significant delays or problems could adversely affect business, financial condition, and results of operations. | **Modified risk factor.** Removed specific product names (Windows, Microsoft 365, etc.) and HoloLens from hardware products. Simplified mention of features that drive post-sale monetization opportunities (no longer mentioning specific products like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat). Removed "product design, and product quality" from potential negative impacts due to perceptions of mismanagement. Expanded potential adverse effects from impacting "revenue" to impacting "business, financial condition, and results of operations." |
| 2   | Risks Related to Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, and Strategic Alliances | Expects to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of long-term business strategy. Examples include acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. (March 2021), Nuance Communications, Inc. (March 2022), announced agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (January 2022), and third phase of OpenAI strategic partnership (January 2023). Challenges and risks include not advancing business strategy, unsatisfactory return on investment, new compliance obligations, difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, distraction of management, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If arrangements fail to anticipate changing circumstances, may result in early termination or renegotiation. Success depends on leveraging acquisitions to enhance existing products or develop new ones, and on acquired companies meeting policies in data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. May take longer than expected to realize benefits, or benefits may be smaller than expected. These events could adversely affect consolidated financial statements. | Expects to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of long-term business strategy. Examples include acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (March 2022), completion of acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (October 2023), and third phase of OpenAI strategic partnership (January 2023). Similar challenges and risks as in 2023. Added note about limited ability to control or influence third parties, which may impact ability to realize anticipated benefits. Added that an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after completion; specifically mentions that the Federal Trade Commission continues to challenge the Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or unwind the transaction. Expanded potential adverse effects to include business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations. | **Modified risk factor.** Updated acquisition status of Activision Blizzard from pending to completed. Removed mention of ZeniMax Media Inc. acquisition. Added risk about limited ability to control or influence third parties. Added risk that acquisitions may be challenged even after completion, specifically mentioning the FTC challenge to the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Expanded potential adverse effects from affecting "consolidated financial statements" to affecting "business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations." |
| 3   | Risk of Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets Impairment | Acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all economic benefits, which could cause impairment of goodwill or intangibles. Reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate possible issues. Tests goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors indicating potential impairment include decline in stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments. Has in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, negatively affecting results of operations. | Same as 2023. | **No significant change** between 2023 and 2024 versions. |
